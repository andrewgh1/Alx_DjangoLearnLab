# Comment System Documentation

This document outlines the comment functionality implemented in the Django Blog project.

## Features

1. View comments on blog posts
2. Add new comments to blog posts (authenticated users only)
3. Edit existing comments (comment authors only)
4. Delete comments (comment authors only)

## How It Works

### Viewing Comments

- All users can view comments on the blog post detail page.
- Comments are displayed below the blog post content.

### Adding a Comment

- Authenticated users can add comments using the comment form at the bottom of the blog post detail page.
- To add a comment, simply type your comment in the text area and click "Submit Comment".

### Editing a Comment

- Comment authors can edit their comments by clicking the "Edit" link next to their comment.
- This will take you to a separate page where you can modify your comment.

### Deleting a Comment

- Comment authors can delete their comments by clicking the "Delete" link next to their comment.
- A confirmation page will be shown before the comment is permanently deleted.

## Permissions

- Viewing comments: All users
- Adding comments: Authenticated users only
- Editing comments: Comment authors only
- Deleting comments: Comment authors only

## Testing the Comment System

1. Start the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to a blog post detail page
3. If not logged in, you should see existing comments but no option to add a comment
4. Log in with an existing account or register a new one
5. Add a new comment to the blog post
6. Edit the comment you just created
7. Delete the comment
8. Log out and verify that you can still view comments but can't add, edit, or delete them

## Security Measures

- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
- `LoginRequiredMixin` ensures only authenticated users can access add, update, and delete views for comments
- `UserPassesTestMixin` ensures only comment authors can edit or delete their own comments
